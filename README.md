# Cancellation Token Example
I was trying to exit from a large loop with an abort. I was struggling to work out how to do it and had read lots of worthy articles on the subject but none were doing what I was trying to do. I asked the question on StackOverflow and within the hour I got an answer which explained it to me. Unfortunately when I went back to credit the person with answering the question they had deleated their answer. As they had explained it to me I decided that I would therefore make a very simple app just incase it is helpful to anyone else.   

In the app we have a loop that we will abort out of using a cancellation token.
